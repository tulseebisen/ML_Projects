# Air Quality Index Prediction

### DESCRIPTION:
Air is what keeps humans alive. Monitoring it and understanding its quality is of immense importance to our well-being.The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India

𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞
1)To identify the Most polluted City based on AQI value

2)Create a Model to Predict the quality of air(Classification to various category like Good,moderate etc)

𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝 : 
•	Tools and Algorithm used: Python, Numpy, Pandas,Matplotlib, sklearn, Random Forest Classifier

•	IDE : Jupyter Notebook

### Here I have 1st calculated the AQI values based upon the values of different pollutants present in air using AQI calculation formula and then done prediction of the air quality for any value of AQI.

(If you are predicting the Air Quality Values using your model It will be a regression problem)
