Where indicated, hourly data (then interpolated) from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis, rp5.ru. Permission was obtained from Reliable Prognosis for the distribution of the 4.5 months of weather data.
  
## Objective:
1) This is a regression task, goal predict the "Appliances" column.
2) Appropriate time series analysis with regression is preferred more.
3) Exploratory data analysis with charts and plots.
  

## Results:

1. Linear regression : 70.43 %

2. Random Forest regressor: 82.49 %
