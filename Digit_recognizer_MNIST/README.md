## **Description**
  MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. 
  Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. 
  As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.
  
  The dataset already has a well-defined train and test dataset that we can use.In order to estimate the performance of a model for a given training run, we can further split the training set into a train and validation dataset
  
## Objective:
  Goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of thousands of handwritten images into classes ranging from 0-9
